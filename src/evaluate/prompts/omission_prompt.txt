You are evaluating a video caption for event omission errors.

Your task is to determine whether any ground truth events are omitted from the caption.

Some ground-truth events may have been artificially inserted for evaluation purposes. These are referred to as "inserted events."

Please follow the steps carefully, and format your output exactly as specified.

───────────────  EVALUATION STEPS  ───────────────
**STEP 1 – GROUND_TRUTH_EVENTS**
- Review both the Ground Truth Caption and the Supporting Visual Description for each event.
- Based on these, extract all events as discrete semantic units that capture meaningful actions, agents, and interactions.
- For each event, write a representative caption focusing on its main action, agent, and key object. Use the supporting visual description only to clarify visual content, not abstract context.
- Number the resulting events (1., 2., …), and clearly mark which ones were artificially inserted for evaluation purposes.

**STEP 2 – OMISSION CRITERIA**
- An event is defined as an **argument structure** including participants (agents/objects) and actions. An event is considered **omitted** if core components are missing such that the event's meaning cannot be sufficiently conveyed — either explicitly, implicitly, through paraphrasing, or visual synonymy.

- Even if certain components of the original event are not explicitly mentioned, the event is not considered omitted as long as its core meaning is preserved and reasonably inferable.

- We evaluate omission at the **event level** based on semantic completeness. An event includes a combination of actions, agents, and key objects that form its core meaning. We do not assess individual words or isolated details.

- **For events whose core meaning contains multiple actions**: If an event's core meaning includes several actions (e.g., "A person wipes, measures, and rolls paper"), the event is considered **INFERRED** if **any one** of those actions is properly described in the caption. Complete omission occurs only when **none** of the actions are mentioned or inferable.

- **Peripheral participants** (e.g., onlookers, bystanders, crowd members, people watching) are **NOT** required for an event to be considered complete. Their absence does **NOT** constitute an omission.

- Minor omissions of **attributes** (e.g., color, age, time, clothing) do NOT count as omissions — unless the missing attribute fundamentally alters the identity or core purpose of the event.

- Incorrect mentions are considered hallucinations, not omissions. If an event is referenced but contains factual errors — such as wrong actions, agents, or objects — it is not an omission but a hallucination.

- Ignore stylistic differences, paraphrasing, or variation in tone — only assess whether the event is **faithfully represented** in meaning.

- We track two types of omissions:
    1. **Total omission**: Ground-truth events that are not mentioned or inferable in the caption.
    2. **Inserted event omission**: Among them, the subset of omitted events that were inserted.

For each ground-truth event, determine whether it is faithfully represented in the caption:
- A ground-truth event is considered **present (INFERRED)** if its core action and agent are reasonably conveyed — either:
    • **Explicitly** – Clearly and directly stated  
    • **Implicitly** – Strongly implied or logically inferable  
    • **Paraphrased** – Reworded but semantically equivalent  
    • **Visually synonymous** – Described differently but visually equivalent (e.g., "a man takes a bite" vs. "a man eats")
- For events whose **core meaning contains multiple actions**, the event is **INFERRED** if **any one** of those actions is properly represented.
- An event is considered **OMITTED** only if **none** of its actions (within the core meaning) are inferable by any of the above methods.
- Supporting Visual Descriptions may assist your understanding, but should not be treated as required evidence.

**STEP 3 – EVENT-BY-EVENT REASONING**  
- For each ground-truth event, write a brief sentence following this format:
    • Event #{N} – This event — [short description] — was [INFERRED / OMITTED] because [detailed justification]. This event [was / was not] an inserted one.

- Justify your judgment based on the omission criteria from Step 2.

**STEP 4 – FINAL DETECTION**  
Provide the conclusive metric only:
- TOTAL_OMISSION_COUNT: [number of all omitted events]
- INSERTED_OMISSION_COUNT: [number of omitted events that were inserted]

GROUND_TRUTH_EVENTS:

CRITERIA_REVIEW:  
- An event is counted as OMITTED only if its **core meaning** (main action + agent + key object) is not recoverable via explicit, paraphrased, implied, or visually synonymous cues in the caption.
- For events whose **core meaning contains multiple actions**, the event is **INFERRED** if **any one** of those actions is properly described.

EVENT-BY-EVENT REASONING:  
• Event #1 – This event — [short description] — was [INFERRED / OMITTED] because [justification]. This event [was / was not] an inserted one.  
• Event #2 – ...  
• Event #3 – ...

FINAL METRICS:  
- TOTAL_OMISSION_COUNT: [number of all omitted events]  
- INSERTED_OMISSION_COUNT: [number of omitted events that were inserted]
