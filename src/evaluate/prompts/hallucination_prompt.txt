You are evaluating a video caption for event hallucination errors.

Your task is to determine whether any events in the inference caption describe information that is not supported by the ground truth events.

Please follow the steps carefully, and format your output exactly as specified.

───────────────  EVALUATION STEPS  ───────────────
**STEP 1 – EXTRACTED_EVENTS**
- Review the inference caption and extract only events that describe concrete agent-action-object interactions
- Each event must capture a meaningful action performed by an agent involving a key object or participant.
- Number the resulting events (1., 2., …)

Do NOT extract any of the following as events:
- Static background descriptions (e.g., crowd, tools, weather, lighting, location, structural surroundings)
- Spatial relationships and static configurations (e.g., "the court is surrounded by a fence", "the room has windows", "there are chairs around the table")
- Existential statements about objects or settings (e.g., "there is a lamp", "the area contains equipment", "a building stands nearby")
- Minor attributes (e.g., color, clothing, age, time of day)
- Text content, on-screen overlays, banners, labels, captions, or subtitles
- Any references to reading, seeing, or describing visible text
- Stylistic or emotional expressions (e.g., "focused expression", "dramatic moment")
- Paraphrased general impressions or vague summaries (e.g., "showcases skills", "demonstrates technique")
- Visual conditions without agent interaction (e.g., “the lighting is dim”, “a ladder is in the background”)
- Any emotional or affective states inferred from appearance (e.g., "looked happy", "seemed determined", "appears moved")

**STEP 2 – HALLUCINATION CRITERIA**  
- An event is defined as an **argument structure** including participants (agents/objects) and actions. An event is considered **hallucinated** if it introduces new factual content that cannot be reasonably supported by ground truth events.

- We evaluate hallucination at the **event level** based on semantic consistency. An event includes a combination of actions, agents, and key objects that form its core meaning. We do not assess individual words or isolated details.

- Even if certain descriptive details are described differently (e.g., colors, sizes, emotional states), the event is not considered hallucinated as long as the core participants (agents/objects) and actions clearly match those in the ground truth events, with no substitutions (e.g., different materials, objects, or action types).

- We focus on detecting:
    1. **New actions**: Actions or behaviors not present or inferable from ground truth
    2. **New participants**: Agents or objects introduced without ground truth support
    3. **Contradictory content**: Information that directly conflicts with ground truth events

- Background elements and minor additions of **attributes** (e.g., color, clothing, environmental details, atmospheric conditions) do NOT count as hallucinations — unless they contradict ground truth or fundamentally introduce new event content.

- Stylistic interpretations, emotional descriptions, reasonable visual inferences, paraphrasing, and variations in tone are not hallucinations.

- Ignore any mentions of text content, overlays, or subtitles when extracting events, and do not count them as hallucinations.

For each extracted event, determine whether it is supported by ground truth content:
- **Explicit** – Clearly and directly stated in ground truth, with the same core components (agents/objects/actions)
- **Implicit** – Strongly implied or logically inferable from ground truth, with the same core components (agents/objects/actions)
- **Paraphrased** – Reworded but semantically equivalent to ground truth content, with the same core components (agents/objects/actions)
- **Visually synonymous** – Different wording is allowed only if the visual event is clearly the same and all core components (agents, objects, actions) remain identical with no substitutions.

If an event is not supported by any of the above, mark it as hallucinated.

**STEP 3 – EVENT-BY-EVENT REASONING**  
- For each extracted event, write a brief sentence following this format:
    • Event #{N} – This event — [short description] — was [SUPPORTED / HALLUCINATED] because [detailed justification].

- Justify your judgment based on the hallucination criteria from Step 2.

**STEP 4 – FINAL DETECTION**  
Provide the conclusive metric only:
- HALLUCINATION_COUNT: [number of hallucinated events]

CRITERIA_REVIEW:  
- Apply the hallucination criteria defined in STEP 2 above.
